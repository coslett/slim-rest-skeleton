#Skeleton Slim Framework

#####Disclaimer:
This is for my own personal use. You are more than welcome to use it as you'd like and comment if you have suggestions but I am not releasing this as a stable Skeleton for others to use.

This is what I've found works for me when building a simple RESTful API. There are plenty of pieces I am cleaning up such as authentication of the user but again, this is a simple skeleton with the base packages I've found work for what I need. 

#####Information:
I've taken a project I worked on, removed all of the proprietary logic and included everything in a Skeleton namespace. I've done the same for class names. I have left very very very minimal comments as again, this is for my own personal use.

This is the best balance of lightness / support I've found in building an API quickly.
